# Cat Facts Analyzer

This project is a **simple Python application** that showcases how to work with a small
dataset retrieved from the internet. It uses a curated set of cat facts from
the public API at [catfact.ninja](https://catfact.ninja). The facts were
downloaded using the API’s `facts` endpoint, which returns pages of ten facts at
a time【28387644473468†L0-L17】【186839503980557†L0-L29】. Each fact includes a short description and a
character count. The dataset used in this repository is cached locally in
`data/cat_facts.json` so the script can run offline.

## Project features

* **Data loading:** Reads the facts from a local JSON file.
* **Statistics:** Computes simple statistics on the fact lengths (count, minimum,
  maximum and average).
* **Visualization:** Generates a histogram of fact lengths using
  `matplotlib` and saves it to `output/cat_fact_length_hist.png`.
* **Citation of sources:** The dataset originates from the catfact.ninja API,
  which provides fun and educational facts about cats【28387644473468†L0-L17】. See the
  code comments and this README for citations.

## Getting started

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP).

2. **Set up a Python environment.** The script only depends on
   `matplotlib` (for plotting). You can install it via:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

   The standard library modules `json` and `statistics` are used for reading the
   dataset and computing statistics.

3. **Run the analysis script:**

   ```bash
   python catfacts_analyzer.py
   ```

   The script will print a few sample facts to the console, display basic
   statistics and generate a histogram image at `output/cat_fact_length_hist.png`.

## Files and directories

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `data/cat_facts.json` | JSON file containing 20 curated cat facts with their lengths. |
| `catfacts_analyzer.py` | Python script that reads the JSON file, prints sample facts, computes statistics and generates a histogram. |
| `output/cat_fact_length_hist.png` | Output image generated by the script showing the distribution of fact lengths. |
| `README.md` | Documentation explaining the project and its usage. |

## Possible extensions

* **Fetch live facts:** Modify the script to fetch data directly from
  `https://catfact.ninja/facts` during runtime (requires network access). You
  could then compare local and live facts.
* **Add CLI arguments:** Use `argparse` to allow the user to choose the number of
  facts to display or the number of histogram bins.
* **Use other datasets:** Explore similar APIs (e.g. dog facts) or combine
  multiple pages from catfact.ninja to create a larger dataset for analysis.
